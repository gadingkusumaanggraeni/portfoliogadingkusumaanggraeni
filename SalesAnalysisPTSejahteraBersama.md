3. This is steps for made master table :
    - From STAR SCHEMA, we know that the primary key of ProductCategory table is CategoryID which refers to Category column in Products table. So, first step is           join 2 table with LEFT JOIN and named product_order.
    - Second step, we know that the primary key of Customer table is CustomerID which referes to CustomerID column in Orders table. So, join 2 column with LEFT            JOIN and named customer_order.
    - End step, join product_order table and customer_order table with primary key is product_number.
