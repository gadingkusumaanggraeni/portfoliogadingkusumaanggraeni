## Project Based Internship ID/X Partners : Credit Risk Modeling 

### Goals
To build model which can predict risk credit with dataset which provide by lending company.

## Overview Case Study
- Credit risk is a risk which must paid by individual or company to individual or company which lend them. 
- A risk is about they can't pay the principal and interest loan. So, it can make loss are :
  1. Disturbance of cash flow, it can make the modal disturb.
  2. Increase operational cost to catch up the late payment
- To decrease the risk credit, data team must predict the loan is good loan or bad loan. The predict is used to determine if they be a good loan, their new loan will accept. But, if they be a bad loan, their new loan will not accept.

## Answer Case Study
To solve this problem, will build model with Classification Analysis.

### Steps :
1. Preview Data set
2. Missing Values & Outlier
3. Visualisasi Data
4. Data Splitting
5. Data Preprocessing
6. Modeling 


Credit Risk Modeling

Credit Risk Modeling adalah suatu analisis untuk membuat model prediksi kredit/pinjaman mana yang akan gagal bayar. Pada kasus ini menggunakan analisis klasifikasi biner (1 : gagal bayar/bad loan dan 0 : bayar tepat waktu, bayar sebelum jatuh tempo/good loan)
